# MERN Book Finder

## Description:

The main goal of this project is take a RESTful API, and refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API.

After completion of the project, I have a better understanding on building a full stack MERN application with React Router, GraphQL, and the React library to improve the functionality, user experience, and create the VDOM to check and render the DOM. I also learned how to use reducers, mutations, and queries effectively to access and manipulate data. And lastly I learned how to use JSON Web Token, or JWT, to add authentication to the site.
